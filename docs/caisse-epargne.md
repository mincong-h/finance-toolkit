# Caisse D'Epargne

## Download

To download my operations, click "Gérer" and then "Télécharger les opérations" on the account that you want to perform the operations. The downloaded file is stored using the following format

```
{DATE}_{ACCOUNT}.csv
```

where the date is stored in a French date format (`DDMMYYYY`), such as `08062025` for 08 June 2025, and the account is the account number of your account in number.

The downloaded CSV file does not contain information related to the account balance. So it needs to be entered into the system manually. See more details on <https://www.aide.caisse-epargne.fr/contents/comment-exporter-mes-operations>.
