# Auto-Completion
# ---------------
# Auto-completion for data enrichment. Finance tools add additional metadata to
# your transactions: type, and category. Declaring auto-completions
# makes the enrichment process automatic: when a transaction label matches the
# declared regular expression, the declared information (type, category,
# regularity) will be added to the transaction.
#

  - expr: '.*FLUNCH.*'
    type: expense
    cat: food/restaurant
