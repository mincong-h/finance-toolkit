# Categories
# ----------
# Declare categories here. Format: `$mainCategory/$subCategory`. Order is not
# important, but it is recommended to declare your list in alphabetic order
# for better readability.
#
categories:
  - food/restaurant
  - food/supermarket
  - food/work
  - gouv/tax

# Auto-Completion
# ---------------
# Auto-completion for data enrichment. Finance tools add additional metadata to
# your transactions: type, category, regularity. Declaring auto-completions
# makes the enrichment process automatic: when a transaction label matches the
# declared regular expression, the declared information (type, category,
# regularity) will be added to the transaction.
#
auto-complete:
  - expr: '.*FLUNCH.*'
    type: expense
    cat: food/restaurant
    regular: True
    desc: Optional description about this matching pattern. We go to Flunch regularly.
  - expr: '.*FOUJITA.*'
    type: expense
    cat: food/restaurant
    regular: False
    desc: Foujita is a nice Japanese restaurant near l'Opéra, we go there sometimes.
  - expr: '.*FRANPRIX 5584.*'
