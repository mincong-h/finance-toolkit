# Finance Toolkit

Finance Toolkit is a command line interface (CLI) that helps you to better understand your personal finance situation by collecting
data from different companies:

| Company | Transaction | Balance | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| [BNP Paribas](https://mabanque.bnpparibas) | Supported | Supported | You can download the CSV files from BNP Paribas' website and use Finance Toolkit to integrate the data. |
| [Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com) | Supported | Supported | You can download the CSV files from Boursorama's website and use Finance Toolkit to integrate the data. |
| [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com) | Supported | Supported | You can download the CSV files from Revolut's website and use Finance Toolkit to integrate the data. |
| [Fortuneo](https://www.fortuneo.fr) | Supported | - | You can download the CSV files from Fortuneo's website and use Finance Toolkit to integrate the data. However, Fortuneo does not provide an account statement so Finance Toolkit does not know the balance of your accounts. |
| Other | - | Partially supported | Declare your account and enter the balance manually in Finance Toolkit. We use this approach for companies like [October](https://october.eu), [Degiro](https://www.degiro.com), and [E\*Trade](https://us.etrade.com/). |

:warning: Currently Finance Toolkit is still in alpha phase and cannot be used easily. You need to
clone the Git repository build from source to make it work. Please contact _mincong.h \[ at \] gmail.com_
if you want to try.

## Install

### Install With Docker

The Docker images are built by CI (GitHub Actions), to use the script with
Docker, you just need to run the commands directly with wrapper script
`docker-finance.sh`:

```sh
# Run Commands, such as:
./bin/docker-finance.sh move
./bin/docker-finance.sh merge
```

### Install Without Docker (Deprecated)

Ensure module `finance-tookit` is ready to be used:

```sh
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/mincong-h/finance-toolkit.git

# go to project
cd finance-toolkit

# Create a new directory called "venv" as virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Enable virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements for tests
pip3 install -r requirements-tests.txt

# Install Finance Toolkit and its dependencies (the finance-toolkit executable will be created)
python setup.py install

# Disable virtual environment
deactivate
```

Create a new directory for storing your finance data. It's recommended to store
them into a Git repository so that data are versioned and changes can be
reverted in any case. For example, to store finance data in `~/finance-data`,
you need to edit `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc` or similar file to include the
following lines:

```sh
export FINANCE_ROOT="${HOME}/finance-data"
export PYTHONPATH="${HOME}/github/finance-toolkit/"
```

Create a new configuration file for configuring your accounts (do not forget to
update the sample to adapt your needs):

```sh
cp /path/to/finance-toolkit/finance-tools.sample.yml "${FINANCE_ROOT}/finance-tools.yml"
```

Modify the download directory inside the configuration file `finance-tools.yml`:

```yml
# Download Directory
# ------------------
# Download directory is the place where finance files are stored at the first
# place. Usually, this is download directory of your OS or your browser.
#   - macOS: ~/Downloads
#
download-dir: ~/Downloads
```

Download files from your banks or other supported companies. Then collect data
into your finance data directory by performing a `tx-move` command:

```
$ tx move

Finished.
```

## Currency

Currently, Finance Toolkit supports multiple currencies, such as euro (EUR) and US dollar (USD).
Currency is defined at account level -- each account can only have one single currency. In the
configuration file (`finance-tools.yml`), specify the currency field. For example, for user "Arya
Stark (astark)", her BNP account "Compte de Ch√®que (CHQ)" in euro should be declared as follows:

```yaml
accounts:
  astark-BNP-CHQ:
    company: BNP
    id: '****1234'
    category: my-category
    currency: EUR
    type: CHQ
    tags: [ ... ]
```

## Hacking

Install pre-commit for day-to-day development. It will ensure a good quality code before commiting anything.

```bash
python -m pip install -U --user pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Testing

Run unit tests (at root level of the project directory):

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## Revolut
